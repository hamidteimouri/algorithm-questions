Find the bug(s) and modify one line of code in the incorrect implementation of a function Solution that is supposed to returns the smallest element of the given non-empty array `A` which contains at most `1000` integers within range `[-1000 .. 1000]` . <br>
Notice that for the example test case `A = [-1 , 1 , -2 , 2]` the attached code is already returning the correct answer `(-2)`.<br>
